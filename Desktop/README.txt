To install and use random.py, download random.py. To download it, go to https://github.com/ezeng17/Crash-Course, click on "Desktop", click on "random.py", and then you can copy the text to a new python file. To run it, you need some sort of program that can run Python, like MacPython. Then, in IDLE, you can run random(n).

The function generates a pseudorandom integer between 0 and n-1, n being a positive integer you enter as a parameter.

For example, you could enter random(10) and the generator would return a number between 0 and 9 inclusive.

The first, second, and third versions were all published on Saturday, November 2nd 2013. The second version added some comments, and the third version added the license, as well as fixed some minor bugs, like not being able to return an integer greater than 6151. It is released on github.com, and all of the versions are available.

The license is the MIT License, available in the file "LICENSE.txt", also in the program random.py itself.
